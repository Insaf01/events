description: This event was a conversation about written law and blockchain code, how does each develop and their differences in the "real world". The objective was to explore how code is transforming the world and law is lagging behind because technological changes are hyper fast. @adcade talked about Decred in the context of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and what makes it different from the rest.
